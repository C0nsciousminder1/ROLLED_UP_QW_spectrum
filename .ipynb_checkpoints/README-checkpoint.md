# ROLLED_UP_QW_spectrum

This repository shows the codes which I used in my physics bachelor's thesis at Industrial University of Santander(UIS), Colombia.   The codes have written in python 3 using Jupyter Lab that you can install by Anaconda application. 

My thesis was about to study the spectral properties of a shallow donor in a semiconductor n-type which is rolled-up in a form to spiral.
